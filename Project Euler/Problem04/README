Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

---

I use a for-loop inside a for-loop to multiply all the numbers from 999 and downwards with eachother. 
When the product of the multiplication is a palindrome, I save it inside a variable only if it is bigger than the last palidrome.
Now I need to drink some coffee! :-)
