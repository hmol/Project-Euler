Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Solution

Here I use a for-loop inside another for-loop to chech each number incremented with 2520 (i+=2520). 
The reason I do this is because the problem-text tells us that 2520 is the lowest number that can be evenly divisible by 1-10.
On every increment of 2520 I check if it is divisable with the numbers from 1-20 (second for-statement).
