Problem 3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

---

My solution is to start with the square root of the number, sqrt(600851475143), and incrementally with 1 count down towards 0.
I use modulus on each of these "count downs", as such: (600851475143 % i).
If the modulus operation reveals that the remainder is zero, we know that the numbers add up. 
If this is true, the number is run trough my isPrime() method, to SUPRISE!! check if the number is prime. 
If so, the answer is given :-)
