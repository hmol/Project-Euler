Problem 9

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.

Solution

To solve this problem I chose to implement the slightly genious formula of Euclid ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Proof_of_Euclid.27s_formula ).
Given integers x and y,
      A = x2 - y2
      B = 2xy
      C = x2 + y2
